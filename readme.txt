== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures? =
Blubrry PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple enclosures per blog post item in your feeds. This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) and the [FeedValidator.org recommendation against it](http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/DuplicateEnclosure.html) is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics? =
 Blubrry PowerPress does not include media statistics. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise lightweight Wordpress podcasting plugin. We recommend you use your media hosting's statistics and you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://www.blubrry.com/podcast_statistics/) as well.

 = Looking for a better Audio Player? =
 Check out the <a href="http://wpaudioplayer.com" target="_blank" title="WP Audio Player 2.0">WP Audio Player 2.0</a>. The WP Audio Player 2.0 options include theme colors, initial volume, player width and more.
