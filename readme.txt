== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = Why doesn't Blubrry Powerpress support multiple enclosures? =
 Blubrry Powerpress does not support multiple enclosures in one blog post. This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistancy and combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) is why the Blubrry Powerpress does not support them.

 = Why doesn't Blubrry Powerpress include media statistics? =
 Blubrry Powerpress does not include media statistics. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise lightweight Wordpress podcasting plugin. We recommend you use your media hosting's statistics and you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://www.blubrry.com/podcast_statistics/) as well.
