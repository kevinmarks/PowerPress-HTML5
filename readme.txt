== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures? =
Blubrry PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple media files for one feed item (blog post). This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) and the [FeedValidator.org recommendation against it](http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/DuplicateEnclosure.html) is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

As a alternative, PowerPress allows you to create additional Custom Podcast Feeds to associate additional media files in a blog post to specific feeds. 

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics built-in? =
 Blubrry PowerPress does not include media statistics built-in. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise efficient Wordpress podcasting plugin. We recommend you use your media hosting's statistics and you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://www.blubrry.com/podcast_statistics/) as well.
 
 As of Blubrry PowerPress version 0.8, you may now access your Blubrry Statistics from within your WordPress dashboard.
 
 = How do you insert the player within a blog post? =
 As of PowerPress 0.9, you can insert the media player within yoru blog posts by using the WordPress shortcode feature. The shortcode for PowerPress is [powerpress] (all lowercase)

 You may use the shortcode to add a player to other media files (non episode files) by specifying the media url in the shortcode: [powerpress url="http://example.com/path/to/media.mp3"]
	
 For advanced users with multiple podcast feeds, you may insert the player for a specific feed by specifying the feed slug in the shortcode: [powerpress feed="podcast"]
 
 If you want to specify a cover image, add an image attribute which points to the specific image url: [powerpress image="http://example.com/path/to/cover_image.jpg"] *Experimental*
	
== Installation ==
1. Copy the entire directory from the downloaded zip file into the /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Activate the "Blubrry PowerPress" plugin in the Plugin Management page.
3. Configure your Blubrry PowerPress by going to the **Settings** > **Blubrry PowerPress** page.
